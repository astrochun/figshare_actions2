**Abstract**
The dataset provided here contains the efforts of independent data aggregation,
quality control, and visualization of the University of Arizona (UofA) COVID-19
testing programs for the 2019 novel Coronavirus pandemic. The dataset is
provided in the form of machine-readable tables in comma-separated value (.csv)
and Microsoft Excel (.xlsx) formats.


**Additional Information**
As part of the UofA response to the 2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic, testing was
conducted on students, staff, and faculty prior to start of the academic year
and throughout the school year. These testings were done at the UofA Campus
Health Center and through their instance program called "Test All Test Smart"
(TATS). These tests identify active cases of SARS-nCoV-2 infections using the
reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test and the Antigen
test. Because the Antigen test provided more rapid diagnosis, it was greatly
used three weeks prior to the start of the Fall semester and throughout the
academic year.

As these tests were occurring, results were provided on the COVID-19 websites.
First, beginning in early March, the Campus Health Alerts website reported the
total number of positive cases. Later, numbers were provided for the total
number of tests (March 12 and thereafter). According to the website, these
numbers were updated daily for positive cases and weekly for total tests.
These numbers were reported until early September where they were then included
in the reporting for the TATS program.


For the TATS program, numbers were provided through the UofA COVID-19 Update
website. Initially on August 21, the numbers provided were the total number
(July 31 and thereafter) of tests and positive cases. Later (August 25),
additional information was provided where both PCR and Antigen testings were
available. Here, the daily numbers were also included. On September 3, this
website then provided both the Campus Health and TATS data. Here, PCR and
Antigen were combined and referred to as "Total", and daily and cumulative
numbers were provided.

At this time, no official data dashboard was available until September 16,
and aside from the information provided on these websites, the full dataset
was not made publicly available. As such, the authors of this dataset
independently aggregated data from multiple sources. These data were made
publicly available through a Google Sheet with graphical illustration provided
through the spreadsheet and on social media. The goal of providing the data
and illustrations publicly was to provide factual information and to understand
the infection rate of SARS-nCoV-2 in the UofA community.

Because of differences in reported data between Campus Health and the TATS
program, the dataset provides Campus Health numbers on September 3 and
thereafter. TATS numbers are provided beginning on August 14, 2020.

**Description of Dataset Content**
The following terms are used in describing the dataset.
1. "Report Date" is the date and time in which the website was updated to
   reflect the new numbers
2. "Test Date" is to the date of testing/sample collection
3. "Total" is the combination of Campus Health and TATS numbers
4. "Daily" is to the new data associated with the Test Date
5. "To Date (07/31--)" provides the cumulative numbers from 07/31 and
   thereafter
6. "Sources" provides the source of information. The number prior to the
   colon refers to the number of sources. Here, "UACU" refers to the UA
   COVID-19 Update page, and "UARB" refers to the UA Weekly Re-Entry Briefing.
   "SS" and "WBM" refers to screenshot (manually acquired) and "WayBackMachine"
   (see Reference section for links) with initials provided to indicate which
   author recorded the values.

The dataset is distinguished where available by the testing program and the
methods of testing. Where data are not available, calculations are made to
fill in missing data (e.g., extrapolating backwards on the total number of
tests based on daily numbers that are deemed reliable). Where errors are
found (by comparing to previous numbers), those are reported on the above
Google Sheet and noted on the disagreement.
